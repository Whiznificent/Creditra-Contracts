# Creditra Risk-Pricing Algorithm — In Depth

This document is the formal description of the on-chain risk-pricing function:
how Creditra computes a credit limit and an interest rate for each borrower,
how interest accrues, how delinquency is priced, and how recovery is settled
in a default auction. Every formula here is implemented in the source under
`contracts/credit/src/{risk.rs,accrual.rs,math_utils.rs,lifecycle.rs}` and is
covered by the test files enumerated in
`contracts/credit/tests/{accrual_overflow_audit.rs,risk_formula_tests.rs,...}`.

Companion docs: `docs/risk-based-rate-formula.md` (terse normative reference),
`docs/interest-accrual.md` (accrual normative reference),
`WHITEPAPER.md` (protocol-level model).

## 1. Inputs the Function Sees

| Input | Type | Range | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Risk score $k$ | `u32` | `[0, MAX_RISK_SCORE=100]` | Off-chain scorer pushed via `update_risk_parameters` (`risk.rs:207`) |
| Credit limit $\ell$ | `i128` | `[MinCreditLimit, MaxCreditLimit]` | Off-chain scorer / admin policy |
| Rate config $(b, s, r_{\min}, r_{\max})$ | `RateFormulaConfig` | each `u32` in `[0, 10_000]`, `r_{\min} \leq r_{\max} \leq 10\,000` | `set_rate_formula_config` (`lib.rs:1159`) |
| Per-borrower floor $r_{\text{floor}}$ | `Option<u32>` | `[0, 10_000]` | `set_borrower_rate_floor` (`lib.rs:578`) |
| Rate-change config $(\Delta r_{\max}, \tau_{\min})$ | `RateChangeConfig` | `bps, seconds` | `set_rate_change_limits` (`lib.rs:569`) |
| Penalty surcharge $\rho$ | `u32` | `[0, 10_000]` | `set_penalty_surcharge_bps` (`lib.rs:587`) |
| Grace period $(T_g, m, r_g)$ | `GracePeriodConfig` | $T_g$ in seconds, mode FullWaiver/ReducedRate, $r_g$ in bps | `set_grace_period_config` (`lib.rs:646`) |
| Utilization $u$ | `i128` | `[0, \ell]` | mutated on draw/repay |
| Accrued interest $I$ | `i128` | `[0, ...)` | mutated on accrual fold |
| Last accrual timestamp $t_{\text{last}}$ | `u64` | unix seconds | updated only when $\Delta I > 0$ |

The on-chain function is therefore deterministic in
$(k, \ell, b, s, r_{\min}, r_{\max}, r_{\text{floor}}, \rho, T_g, m, r_g, u, I, t_{\text{last}}, t_{\text{now}})$
— there is no hidden state.

---

## 2. The Rate Function

### 2.1 Formal definition

Let

$$
\mathrm{clamp}(x, a, b) = \min(\max(x, a), b)
$$

The on-chain rate function `compute_rate_from_score`
(`contracts/credit/src/risk.rs:77`) is:

$$
r(k) = \mathrm{clamp}\Big(b + k \cdot s, \; r_{\min}, \; \min(r_{\max}, R_{\text{cap}})\Big)
$$

where $R_{\text{cap}} = \text{MAX\_INTEREST\_RATE\_BPS} = 10\,000$
(`risk.rs:24`).

The implementation uses **saturating** arithmetic on the `u32`
multiplication, so a misconfigured `b + 100·s > u32::MAX` saturates rather
than overflowing. The clamp then brings it back into the configured range.

Equivalent pseudocode:

```rust
pub fn compute_rate_from_score(cfg: &RateFormulaConfig, k: u32) -> u32 {
    let raw   = cfg.base_rate_bps.saturating_add(k.saturating_mul(cfg.slope_bps_per_score));
    let upper = cfg.max_rate_bps.min(MAX_INTEREST_RATE_BPS);
    raw.clamp(cfg.min_rate_bps, upper)
}
```

### 2.2 Per-borrower floor

After the formula computes $r(k)$, an optional per-borrower floor
$r_{\text{floor}}$ is applied:

$$
r_{\text{eff}}(k, \text{borrower}) = \max\big(r(k), \; r_{\text{floor}}(\text{borrower}) \big)
$$

The floor is stored under `DataKey::RateFloorBps(Address)` (Persistent,
`contracts/credit/src/storage.rs:357`). Use cases: a borrower in a higher-risk
jurisdiction, or one with a sticky penalty history, can be assigned a hard
minimum rate that overrides a favorable formula.

### 2.3 Rate-change cap

`update_risk_parameters` (`risk.rs:207`) further constrains rate changes via
`RateChangeConfig`:

$$
|r_{\text{new}} - r_{\text{old}}| \leq \Delta r_{\max} \quad \text{AND} \quad t_{\text{now}} - t_{\text{last\_rate\_update}} \geq \tau_{\min}
$$

Violations revert:

- Magnitude breach → `ContractError::RateTooHigh = 8`
- Cadence breach → `ContractError::TimestampRegression = 33`

`last_rate_update_ts` is only advanced when a rate actually changes, so a
no-op `update_risk_parameters` does not reset the cadence clock.

### 2.4 Worked numerical example — rate

Configure:

```
base_rate_bps = 200       // 2.00 % floor
slope_bps_per_score = 50  // 0.5 % per score point
min_rate_bps = 200        // 2.00 %
max_rate_bps = 5000       // 50.00 %
```

For $k \in \{0, 25, 50, 75, 100\}$:

| $k$ | $b + k \cdot s$ | clamp to $[200, 5000]$ | $r(k)$ (APR) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0   | 200       | 200       | 2.00 %  |
| 25  | 1450      | 1450      | 14.50 % |
| 50  | 2700      | 2700      | 27.00 % |
| 75  | 3950      | 3950      | 39.50 % |
| 100 | 5200      | 5000      | 50.00 % (clamped) |

A borrower with $r_{\text{floor}} = 1000$ at $k=0$ would see $r_{\text{eff}}
= \max(200, 1000) = 1000$ (10.00 %).

This example is the canonical test fixture in `tests/risk_formula_tests.rs`.

---

## 3. The Credit-Limit Function

In v1 the on-chain function accepts an admin-supplied `credit_limit` and
validates it. The off-chain composition is:

$$
\ell(\text{borrower}) = \mathrm{clip}\Big(\ell_{\text{base}} \cdot f(k, h, a, \alpha), \; \ell_{\text{min}}, \; \ell_{\text{max}}\Big)
$$

where:

- $\ell_{\text{base}}$ is a per-protocol base limit (e.g. 100 XLM
  equivalent) set by policy.
- $f(k, h, a, \alpha)$ is the off-chain multiplier as a function of the
  score $k$, history vector $h$ (repayments, recoveries), attestation
  bundle $a$, and the historical default recovery probability $\alpha$.
- $\ell_{\text{min}}, \ell_{\text{max}}$ are the on-chain bounds set by
  `set_credit_limit_bounds(min, max)` (`lib.rs:862`, validated in
  `lifecycle.rs:78-145`).

The on-chain validation enforces:

$$
\ell_{\text{min}} \leq \ell \leq \ell_{\text{max}}, \quad \ell \geq 0
$$

Violations revert `LimitOutOfBounds = 34` or `NegativeLimit = 7`.

### 3.1 The Restricted promotion path

`update_risk_parameters` reduces the limit relative to current utilization.
If the new $\ell < u$, the contract does **not** revert — it sets
`status = Restricted` (`risk.rs:207`). The borrower:

- Cannot draw further (the limit check fails).
- Can still repay normally.
- On repayments that reduce $u$ below the new $\ell$, the line auto-cures
  back to `Active`.

The off-chain protocol design intent is that a scorer who detects increased
risk (e.g. a counterparty default in the borrower's transaction graph) can
unilaterally tighten the credit line without forcing an immediate default —
the line is rate-limited rather than terminated.

### 3.2 Global exposure cap

`MaxTotalExposure` (`lib.rs:827`) is an absolute ceiling:

$$
\sum_{i} u_i + a \leq \text{MaxTotalExposure} \quad \text{(checked on every draw)}
$$

Violations revert `ExposureCapExceeded = 31`. This is the protocol-wide
circuit breaker that bounds total loss from a misbehaving scorer or
misconfigured limits.

### 3.3 Per-borrower utilization cap

`UtilizationCapBps(borrower)` (`storage.rs:364`) is the per-borrower draw
ratio cap, applied at draw time as:

$$
u + a \leq \frac{\ell \cdot \text{cap\_bps}}{10\,000}
$$

`cap_bps = 0` removes the cap. Documented in `docs/utilization-cap.md`.

---

## 4. Interest Accrual

### 4.1 The fold (live formula)

`apply_accrual` (`contracts/credit/src/accrual.rs:87`) is invoked at the
head of every state-mutating entrypoint. The pure-math part is in
`math_utils::prorate_interest`
(`contracts/credit/src/math_utils.rs:244`):

$$
\Delta I = \left\lfloor \frac{u \cdot r_{\text{eff}} \cdot \Delta t}{10\,000 \cdot Y} \right\rfloor
$$

where:

- $u$ is `utilized_amount` at the start of the fold
- $r_{\text{eff}}$ is the **effective** rate in bps (see §4.2)
- $\Delta t = t_{\text{now}} - t_{\text{last}}$ in seconds
- $Y$ = `SECONDS_PER_YEAR = 31_557_600` (Julian year,
  `math_utils.rs:60`)
- Floor rounding via `Rounding::Floor` (`math_utils.rs:76`)

Capitalization:

$$
u' = u + \Delta I, \quad I_{\text{accrued}}' = I_{\text{accrued}} + \Delta I
$$

$t_{\text{last}}' = t_{\text{now}}$ **only if** $\Delta I > 0$. This avoids
the silent-zeroing pathology where a sub-tick call zeroes the time delta
without ever charging interest.

If $u = 0$ or $t_{\text{now}} \leq t_{\text{last}}$, the fold is a no-op
and $t_{\text{last}}$ is preserved exactly.

### 4.2 The three branches of effective rate

`apply_accrual` chooses $r_{\text{eff}}$ based on line state and delinquency:

#### Branch A — Active line, current

$$
r_{\text{eff}} = r
$$

where $r$ is `interest_rate_bps`. Standard case.

#### Branch B — Active line, delinquent

If `is_delinquent(borrower) == true`
(`query.rs:57`, which checks $t_{\text{now}} > \text{next\_due\_ts} +
\text{grace}$ saturating-add), the surcharge $\rho$ applies:

$$
r_{\text{eff}} = \min(r + \rho, \; R_{\text{cap}})
$$

The first delinquent accrual emits `PenaltyRateEnteredEvent` (topic
`("credit","pen_enter")`); the first non-delinquent accrual after delinquency
emits `PenaltyRateExitedEvent` (`("credit","pen_exit")`). Source:
`accrual.rs`, events in `events.rs:278,296`.

#### Branch C — Suspended line with grace policy

If the line is `Suspended` and a `GracePeriodConfig { T_g, m, r_g }` is set,
$\Delta t$ is split:

$$
\Delta t_g = \min(\Delta t, T_g), \quad \Delta t_p = \Delta t - \Delta t_g
$$

Then:

$$
\Delta I = \begin{cases}
\mathrm{prorate}(u, r, \Delta t_p) & \text{if } m = \text{FullWaiver} \\
\mathrm{prorate}(u, r_g, \Delta t_g) + \mathrm{prorate}(u, r, \Delta t_p) & \text{if } m = \text{ReducedRate}
\end{cases}
$$

`FullWaiver` is the default (`GraceWaiverMode::FullWaiver = 0`,
`types.rs:267`).

### 4.3 Why simple interest, capitalized at mutation?

Two reasons:

1. **Gas predictability.** Per-call accrual cost is $O(1)$ — one mul, one
   div, one storage write per affected key. There is no on-chain compounding
   loop. A borrower who never touches the line for 5 years incurs the same
   accrual cost as one who repays daily.

2. **Floor rounding favors the borrower.** Every $\Delta I$ rounds down.
   The aggregate bias is against protocol revenue, never against borrower
   balance. This is intentional — it makes the contract trivially safe to
   audit for rounding-direction attacks.

The model in `docs/interest-accrual.md` notes this as a "checkpoint-on-
mutation" design and contrasts it with the per-block accrual of
Aave/Compound (which requires a separate `accrue` keeper or per-call
state mutation on every read).

### 4.4 Worked numerical example — accrual

A borrower draws **1 000 XLM** (with XLM as a 7-decimal asset, so the
on-chain `i128` value is $1\,000 \cdot 10^7 = 10\,000\,000\,000$ stroops).
Their rate is $r = 1\,500$ bps (15.00 % APR).

After **30 days** (Δt = 2 592 000 seconds):

$$
\Delta I = \left\lfloor \frac{10\,000\,000\,000 \cdot 1\,500 \cdot 2\,592\,000}{10\,000 \cdot 31\,557\,600} \right\rfloor
$$

Numerator: $10^{10} \cdot 1.5 \cdot 10^3 \cdot 2.592 \cdot 10^6
 = 3.888 \cdot 10^{19}$
Denominator: $10^4 \cdot 3.15576 \cdot 10^7 = 3.15576 \cdot 10^{11}$
Quotient: $3.888 \cdot 10^{19} / 3.15576 \cdot 10^{11}
 \approx 1.23204 \cdot 10^{8}$

$$
\Delta I \approx 123\,205\,479 \text{ stroops} \approx 12.32 \text{ XLM}
$$

This is the realized 30-day interest at 15 % APR on 1 000 XLM, which is the
expected result (15 % × 30/365.25 × 1 000 ≈ 12.32 XLM). The on-chain stored
value is exactly $\lfloor 38\,880\,000\,000 / 315.576 \rfloor$, which the
test fixture in `tests/accrual_overflow_audit.rs` confirms.

If the borrower is now delinquent (past `next_due_ts + grace`) with a
$\rho = 500$ bps surcharge, the effective rate becomes $r_{\text{eff}} =
\min(1\,500 + 500, 10\,000) = 2\,000$ bps (20 % APR). The 30-day Δ$I$
recomputes to ~16.43 XLM, and a `PenaltyRateEnteredEvent` is emitted on
the first such accrual.

### 4.5 Worked numerical example — grace + ReducedRate

Same 1 000 XLM at 15 % APR, but the line is `Suspended` and the borrower
calls `repay_credit` **45 days** after suspension. `GracePeriodConfig` is
set with $T_g = 30\,\text{d}$, $m = \text{ReducedRate}$,
$r_g = 500$ bps (5 %).

Split:

- $\Delta t_g = \min(45\,\text{d}, 30\,\text{d}) = 30\,\text{d} = 2\,592\,000$ s
- $\Delta t_p = 45 - 30 = 15\,\text{d} = 1\,296\,000$ s

Grace-period accrual at 5 % APR for 30 days on 1 000 XLM:
$\approx 4.10$ XLM

Post-grace accrual at 15 % APR for 15 days:
$\approx 6.16$ XLM

Total $\Delta I \approx 10.27$ XLM.

Compare to no-grace accrual (45 days at 15 %): $\approx 18.48$ XLM.

The grace mode reduced the realized interest by ~8.20 XLM.

---

## 5. Repayment Allocation

`repay_credit` (`lib.rs:437-556`) allocates a repayment $a$ as
**interest-first, then principal, then protocol fee on the interest portion**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
a_{\text{eff}} &= \min(a, u) \\
a_I &= \min(a_{\text{eff}}, I_{\text{accrued}}) \\
a_P &= a_{\text{eff}} - a_I \\
\text{fee} &= \left\lfloor \frac{a_I \cdot \phi}{10\,000} \right\rfloor \\
a_{\text{reserve}} &= a_{\text{eff}} - \text{fee}
\end{aligned}
$$

where $\phi = \text{ProtocolFeeBps} \leq \text{MAX\_PROTOCOL\_FEE\_BPS} =
1\,000$ (`lib.rs:63`). The fee is `transfer_from(borrower, contract, fee)`
(accumulates in `TreasuryBalance`); the reserve portion is
`transfer_from(borrower, liquidity_source, a_reserve)`. The admin later
calls `withdraw_treasury(admin)` (`lib.rs:770`) to drain accumulated fees
to `TreasuryAddress`.

### 5.1 Why interest-first?

If repayments were applied principal-first, a borrower making the minimum
payment that covers interest would never amortize. Interest-first is the
amortization-honest split that gives the borrower deterministic principal
reduction per repayment dollar past the interest portion.

### 5.2 Why fee on interest only?

Charging the fee on principal would make the protocol fee an additional
borrowing cost, distinct from the interest rate. Fee-on-interest is
algebraically equivalent to: "the protocol takes a fixed cut of the
interest revenue". The borrower sees only the headline rate
$r$ as their cost; the fee is a partition of the protocol's revenue, not
a separate charge. This is also why fee accounting is independent of
principal repayments — `FeeAccruedEvent` is emitted only when
$a_I > 0$ (`events.rs:170`).

### 5.3 Worked numerical example — repayment

Continuing the §4.4 scenario. After 30 days the borrower owes:
- Principal: 1 000 XLM
- Accrued interest: 12.32 XLM
- Total utilized (post-capitalization): 1 012.32 XLM

The borrower repays $a = 100$ XLM. Suppose $\phi = 200$ bps (2 % fee on
interest).

$a_{\text{eff}} = \min(100, 1\,012.32) = 100$ XLM
$a_I = \min(100, 12.32) = 12.32$ XLM
$a_P = 100 - 12.32 = 87.68$ XLM
$\text{fee} = \lfloor 12.32 \cdot 200 / 10\,000 \rfloor \approx 0.246$ XLM
$a_{\text{reserve}} = 100 - 0.246 = 99.754$ XLM

State after repay:
- Treasury balance: $+0.246$ XLM
- Reserve receives: $99.754$ XLM (out of borrower's allowance)
- Accrued interest: $0$
- Utilized: $1\,012.32 - 100 = 912.32$ XLM
- Schedule's `next_due_ts` advanced by floor($100 / \text{amount\_per\_period}$)
  installments.

## 6. Default & Dutch-Auction Recovery

### 6.1 Default trigger

`default_credit_line(borrower)` (`lifecycle.rs:450`) transitions the line
to `Defaulted`. The accrual is applied before the transition so the
recorded `utilized_amount` is the realized debt at default. An event
`("credit","liq_req")` is emitted with the outstanding amount
(`events.rs:236`):

```
DefaultLiquidationRequestedEvent {
    borrower: Address,
    utilized_amount: i128,   // the debt
}
```

Off-chain orchestrator listens for this topic and constructs an auction.

### 6.2 English auction (default mode)

Minimum next bid:

$$
\text{min\_next\_bid} = \max\Big( \lceil \text{highest\_bid} \cdot (1 + \mu/10\,000) \rceil, \; \text{highest\_bid} + 1 \Big)
$$

where $\mu$ is `min_increment_bps` (`init_auction` parameter, capped at
10 000). The `+1` floor prevents zero-increment grief at very small bids.

Refund of previous bidder is atomic with new bid record, under the
reentrancy guard (`storage.rs:316`, `lib.rs` `place_bid` English branch).

Anti-snipe: see `WHITEPAPER.md` §6.3 — documented in PR #430 but not
active in the live `place_bid` path; tracked as a known gap.

### 6.3 Dutch auction

`AuctionMode::Dutch` with init params `dutch_start_price = p_0`,
`dutch_floor_price = p_f`, plus optional `dutch_decay` and
`dutch_step_count`.

- `dutch_decay = Linear` (or omitted) keeps the original linear decay:

$$
p(t) = p_0 - (p_0 - p_f) \cdot \frac{\min(t, T)}{T}, \quad T = \text{end\_time} - \text{start\_time}
$$

- `dutch_decay = Stepped` splits the same total drop into
  `dutch_step_count` equal time buckets and reprices only at bucket
  boundaries. `dutch_step_count` is required and must be greater than zero.

A bid $a$ qualifies if $a \geq p(t) \land a \geq \text{min\_bid}$. The first
qualifying bid atomically flips the auction to `Closed` and records the
winner.

#### 6.3.1 Worked example — Dutch curve

Auction with $p_0 = 1\,200$ XLM, $p_f = 600$ XLM, $T = 3\,600$ seconds
(1 hour), $\text{min\_bid} = 500$ XLM.

| $t$ (seconds elapsed) | $p(t)$ |
|---|---|
| 0     | 1 200 XLM |
| 600   | 1 100 XLM |
| 1 200 | 1 000 XLM |
| 1 800 | 900 XLM   |
| 2 400 | 800 XLM   |
| 3 000 | 700 XLM   |
| 3 600 | 600 XLM   |
| 4 200 | 600 XLM (clamped to floor) |

A bid of 1 050 XLM at $t = 600$ wins (since $1\,050 \geq 1\,100$ is false →
bid is **rejected** as `BidTooLow = 7`). A bid of 1 100 XLM at $t = 600$
wins. The qualifying check is strict: $a \geq p(t)$.

### 6.4 Settlement back into the credit contract

After the auction closes, admin calls
`settle_default_liquidation(borrower, recovered_amount, settlement_id, oracle_price)`
on the credit contract (`lib.rs:953`). The cross-contract call to the
auction's `settle_default_liquidation(settlement_id, credit_addr, borrower)`
returns `highest_bid: i128`, and the credit contract asserts this equals
the admin-supplied `recovered_amount` (else `InvalidAmount`).

Accounting:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{interest\_settled} &= \min(\text{recovered\_amount}, I_{\text{accrued}}) \\
\text{principal\_settled} &= \text{recovered\_amount} - \text{interest\_settled} \\
u' &= u - \text{recovered\_amount} \\
I_{\text{accrued}}' &= I_{\text{accrued}} - \text{interest\_settled}
\end{aligned}
$$

If $u' = 0$, status becomes `Closed` and the repayment schedule is cleared.
The settlement event `DefaultLiquidationSettledEvent` (topic
`("credit","liq_setl")`) records the full breakdown for the indexer.

### 6.5 Recovery rate accounting

The protocol's empirical recovery rate for a line is:

$$
\eta(\text{line}) = \frac{\sum \text{recovered\_amount}}{\text{utilized\_amount at default}}
$$

This is computable directly from on-chain events:
$\text{utilized\_amount}$ comes from the `("credit","defaulted")` event;
$\sum \text{recovered\_amount}$ is the sum over all
`("credit","liq_setl")` events for that borrower. The scorer should feed
this back into future $f(k, h, a, \alpha)$ computations.

---

## 7. Anti-Snipe Semantics (Spec, Tracked as Open)

The intended anti-snipe behavior, per PR #430, is:

- An **extension window** $W$ before `end_time`.
- A **bid extension** $E$ added to `end_time` if a qualifying bid lands
  inside $W$.

Pseudocode:

```rust
if state.config.end_time - now < ANTI_SNIPE_WINDOW_SECS {
    state.config.end_time = state.config.end_time + ANTI_SNIPE_EXTEND_SECS;
}
```

Live `place_bid` (`gateway-contract/.../lib.rs`) does **not** extend
`end_time` and instead hard-rejects bids when `now >= end_time`. The
extension is documented but not active in this release. See
`docs/SECURITY.md` known gaps (§6.1) and `WHITEPAPER.md` §6.3.

## 8. Comparison to Other Protocols' Pricing

| Protocol | Rate determination | Limit determination | Penalty mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| Aave v3 | Utilization-curve (`r = r_0 + u·slope1` below kink, kinked slope above) | Fixed LTV × collateral, fixed liquidation threshold | Liquidation bonus to keeper |
| Compound v3 | Utilization-curve | Per-asset risk parameter × collateral | Same |
| MakerDAO Spark | Stability fee (governance vote) | Vault min-collat ratio | Stability fee + auction discount |
| **Creditra** | **`r = clamp(b + k·s, r_min, min(r_max, 10000))` clamped by RateChangeConfig** | **Off-chain score × policy multiplier, clipped to admin bounds** | **Penalty surcharge ρ added to base rate; grace mode; cross-contract auction recovery** |

Key differences:

1. **The borrower's behavior** (the score $k$) is a first-class input to the
   rate, not just to eligibility. A behaving borrower in good standing pays
   less; the rate adjustment is bounded by `RateChangeConfig` to prevent
   shock.
2. **No utilization curve.** Creditra's per-borrower rate is set by score,
   not by aggregate pool utilization. The market-wide utilization signal can
   be folded into the score off-chain if desired.
3. **The recovery rate is empirical**, not assumed. Each settlement
   contributes one data point to the protocol's recovery distribution.
4. **The penalty surcharge has an exit** (`PenaltyRateExitedEvent`). A
   delinquent borrower who cures returns to the base rate — this is the
   on-chain equivalent of a "good standing" credit-card mechanic.
